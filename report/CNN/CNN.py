# @section intro_sec Introduction
#
# This documentation provides an overview of a Python script for image classification using a Convolutional Neural
# Network (CNN). The code utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset and the Keras library for building and training the CNN model.
#
# @section cifar10_dataset CIFAR-10 Dataset
#
# The script loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, performs data preprocessing, and splits it into training, validation, and
# test sets.
# @image html CIFAR10FirstNineImages.png "First 9 images in the CIFAR-10 dataset." width=500px
#
#
# @section image_augmentation Image Augmentation
#
# Data augmentation is applied using the ImageDataGenerator from Keras to increase the diversity of the training
# dataset.
#
# @section model_definition CNN Model Definition
#
# The CNN model is defined using Keras Sequential API. It consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout
# layers, nd dense layers for classification. The model summary is provided for reference.
##
# @section model_training Model Training
#
# The model is compiled using categorical crossentropy loss and the RMSprop optimizer. ModelCheckpoint is used as a
# callback to save the best weights during training. The script then trains the model using augmented data.
#
# @section training_results Training Results
#
# The training results, including accuracy and loss, are stored in the 'hist' variable. The script also plots and
# saves the first nine images from the training dataset for visualization.
#
# @section start Getting Started
#
# @warning Before running the script, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. Additionally,
# verify that the 'model.weights.best.hdf5' file is correctly saved during training for later use.
#
# @note For further details on the code and Keras functionalities, refer to the inline comments within the script.
